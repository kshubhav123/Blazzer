React js -: 
React JS is a way to build fast and interactive user interfaces. It is easy to learn and use, and it is very popular with companies like Facebook, Netflix, and Airbnb.

Key and benifits
Key benefits of using React JS:
Fast: React JS uses a virtual DOM to update the UI efficiently, which makes your website or app run faster.
Interactive: React JS makes it easy to build user interfaces that are responsive and interactive.
Easy to learn and use: React JS has a simple and intuitive API, which makes it easy to learn and use.
Popular: React JS is one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces, so there is a large community of developers who can help you if you need it.

Component: A component in React is a reusable piece of code that can be used to build user interfaces. Components are the building blocks of React applications, and they can be used to create anything from a simple button to a complex user interface.

DOM : The DOM is used by web browsers to render HTML and XML documents, and it is also used by JavaScript to interact with those documents. For example, JavaScript can be used to change the content or style of a document, or to add or remove elements from the document.The DOM is a powerful tool that can be used to create dynamic and interactive web pages.

Virtual DOM : The virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM that is kept in memory. 
The virtual DOM in React.js is a lightweight JavaScript representation of the real DOM. It is used by React to efficiently update the UI when data changes

JSX : JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a syntax extension to JavaScript that allows you to write HTML and XML directly in your JavaScript code. JSX is not required to use React, but it is highly recommended, as it makes it much easier to write and maintain React components.JSX is a powerful tool that can make writing React components easier and more efficient. 

state : The state in React.js is a plain JavaScript object that stores data that may change over the lifetime of a component. When the state changes, React re-renders the component.

props : Props in React.js are arguments passed into React components. They are used to pass data from one component to another. Props are read-only, and they cannot be changed by the component that receives them.


props vs state : The main difference between props and state in React.js is that props are immutable and state is mutable.
Props are arguments passed into React components. They are used to pass data from one component to another.
State is a plain JavaScript object that stores data that may change over the lifetime of a component. When the state changes, React re-renders the component.

Lifecycle Methods : React component lifecycle methods are called at specific points in the lifecycle of a component, such as when it is mounted, updated, or unmounted. These methods allow you to control the component's behavior and perform specific actions at different stages of its lifecycle
Mounting : componentDidMount()
Updating : shouldComponentUpdate()
Unmounting : componentWillUnmount()

Event Handling : Event handling is the process of responding to user interactions or other events that occur in a software application. It is a key part of developing interactive user interfaces (UIs) and web applications.


Data Binding : Data binding in React is the process of connecting the data of a React component to its UI. This allows the UI to be updated automatically when the data changes.

useEffect : useEffect is a function that allows you to perform side effects in your components. Side effects are actions that can affect something outside of the component itself, such as making an HTTP request, updating the DOM, or setting a timer.
You can use useEffect to do things like:
Fetch data from an API.
Update the DOM when the component's state changes.
Clean up side effects when the component unmounts.

Fragement : A fragment in React is a special type of component that allows you to group multiple elements together without adding an extra DOM node. 

Refs : 
Refs are a feature in React that allow you to access DOM elements and React elements created in the render method.

1. Using the createRef() function: This function creates a new ref object and returns it. You can then assign the ref object to a component property or variable.
2. Using the useRef() hook: This hook creates a new ref object and returns it. You can then use the ref object in your component code.

useRef is a React hook that allows you to access DOM elements and React elements created in the render method.

- becasue its array first , second variable this type of store value ex-: 
consr arrr=useState("Deepika")
const name=arr[0]
const setName = arr[1]
